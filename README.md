# Project-Koi
A simple game engine built from the ground up in c++


How to install manually:
------------------------

Download code and run make to generate the dylib files into bin.<br>
To only use specific modules, generate each one individually by running<br>
```zsh
make libkoi-MODULE_NAME.dylib
```
<br>

Where MODULE_NAME can be the following:

- audio - jk! theres no files for this yet
- graphics
- networking - jk! theres no files for this yet
<br>
Copy the contents of bin to usr/local/lib<br>
You'll also need to copy the contents of include to /usr/local/include.<br>
Probably.<br><br>


this probably only works for mac and even then probably not<br>




How to install:
---------------

Run
```zsh
make install
```

if you get an error I havent learned how to do it yet


I'm still learning all this stuff so heres a picture of a fish:
