# Project-Koi
A simple game engine built from the ground up in c++


How to install manually:
Download code and run make to generate the dylib files into bin.
To only use specific modules, generate each one individually by running
make libkoi-MODULE_NAME.dylib

where MODULE_NAME can be the following:
audio - jk! theres no files for this yet
graphics
networking - jk! theres no files for this yet
Copy the contents of bin to usr/local/lib
you'll also need to copy the contents of include to /usr/local/include
probably

this probably only works for mac and even then probably not


How to install:
Run make install
if you get an error I havent learned how to do it yet
